				<h1>FUN UNDER THE MOON</h1>
				<p>A visit to San Fernando City La Union would not be completed without going to the
				famous Night Market. It's a place where you can find the list of street foods like 
				barbeque, kwek-kwek, shawarma, taco balls, isaw, fishball, drinks like fruit shakes
				and the dinner meals.</p>
					<p>Who would resist their delicious and affordable meals like grilled pusit, bulalo, 
				sinanglaw, ilocano and Filipino meals like Dinengdeng and Dinakdakan. With a budget 
				of less than a hundred pesos, you’ll eat like a king</p>
					<p>Unlike other street food areas, this place is always kept clean, you won’t see any
				trash at the streets, even people who are quite meticulous in buying food won’t 
				hesitate to eat or buy from here.</p>
